# Web Visualization Dashboard


## Latitude Analysis Dashboard

I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations from previous repositories. Specifically, we'll be plotting weather data.

In building this dashboard, we'll create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

### Website Requirements

The website consisted of 7 pages total, including:

* A landing page containing:
  * An explanation of the project
  * Links to each visualizations page. There is a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image takes the user to that visualization

* Four visualization pages, each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance

* A "Comparisons" page that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them
  * Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations

* A "Data" page that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.

The website also has a navigation menu that:

* Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page
* Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualization page
* Provides two more text links on the right: "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page.
* Is responsive (using media queries)
